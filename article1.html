                    In the wake of the new COVID-19 world, where a lot of businesses and industries witnessed darkness closing in on them, a certain industry saw this as the rise of a new dawn in their quest toward ultimate supremacy – the E-Learning industry. Fast-forward two years, while it’s still up for debate whether it has been successful in its quest, one thing is certain; in India, it has changed the landscape of education forever. Not only has it made education more affordable and accessible but has also made revolutionary changes in the way a modern student learns and understands concepts. In this article, we will specifically talk about JEE (Joint Entrance Examination), which holds the status of being one of the toughest examinations to crack in the world. We will investigate and discuss in length some of the best free resources available for JEE preparation on the web. So, let’s get started!  
                </p>
                <img src="./img/IIT-KGP.webp" class="img" alt="">
                
                    <h3>JEE (Joint Entrance Examination) </h3>
                    <p>
                        On average, about eight-ten lakh students appear for the Joint Entrance Examination every year, for a seat in the best engineering colleges in our country – IITs. It is a two-part examination, the first exam called JEE Mains, and the second, JEE Advanced. Students who secure an All-India-Rank (AIR) of two lakh or above are eligible to sit for the JEE Advanced exam, and then compete amongst each other for the ten-thousand available IIT seats.  

So, in an examination where the selection ratio is less than 5%, the preparation needs to be extensive as well. So, whether you’re a class XII or a drop-year student battling against time to cover the huge syllabus, or you’ve recently moved into class XI, and you have enough time in your hands, or you’re just a class IX or a class X student on the lookout for a head start; if you belong to any one of these categories and are overwhelmed by the sheer number of resources available online and unsure which one to follow, then this article is perfect for you. 

In order to help you with your preparation, here are some of the best free resources on the web –  
                    </p>
                    <h3>Subject - Physics </h3>
                    <h5>1. Physics Wallah - Alakh Pandey </h5>

                    <p>From teaching on a whiteboard with a marker to building an entire educational platform with hundreds of teachers conducting year-long batches, the name Alakh Pandey has gained a lot of popularity among class 11th and 12th students. If you think you have an ample amount of time on your hands, you should check out his Physics video lectures where he teaches on the good-old whiteboard (I mention time here because his video lectures offer an in-depth explanation of a particular topic, and so covering a huge chapter like Ray-Optics from his lectures might take you a very long time.) Physics is a tricky subject to understand, but the ability to explain complex concepts without the help of any animation/graphics marks the true greatness of any teacher. The way he injects humour into teaching and always manages to hold the student’s attention without allowing them to feel bored is truly commendable. Since these are recorded lectures, you can watch and rewind them as many times as you want. Watch his lectures, solve problems from a book like D.C. Pandey and all the Previous Year Questions, and voila! You have mastered the chapter. If you think Physics Wallah is the platform for you, then you should consider their year-long batches where they teach not just Physics, but Chemistry and Math also. You can get them at affordable prices. It’s an investment you surely would not regret! </p>

                    <h5>2. Physics Galaxy</h5>

                    <p>Probably one of the oldest YouTube channels in the field of JEE, Physics Galaxy is a channel run by Ashish Arora sir, who has taught and mentored thousands of top AIR students. He has done a phenomenal job providing video Illustrations on various topics of JEE physics over the years. His recent “Revision Checklist” playlist covers the entire class XI and XII syllabus in the most concise and crisp manner. Not only does he discuss the important concepts from each chapter, but also the probable questions which can be framed from those concepts. The channel also contains solved illustrations of NCERT exercises and numerous advanced-level problems, for further solidifying the concepts of students. From time to time, he also posts motivational shorts on the channel to keep his students motivated in their JEE journey. He has authored multiple books for IIT-JEE Physics, which are widely referred to amongst students. So, if you want to take your JEE Physics preparation to the next level and efficiently revise your entire syllabus in the shortest time possible, then you should check out this channel! </p>

                    <h3>Subject – Math </h3>

                    <h5>1. Unacademy JEE: </h5>

                    <p>Unacademy JEE is a YouTube channel started in the year 2019, with the aim of providing free and quality content for all. Although they teach all three subjects i.e., Physics, Chemistry, and Math, the Math faculties probably managed to steal the most hearts. Math is a subject that petrifies millions of students, and they start developing a phobia of the subject and ultimately end up neglecting it. But if you’re preparing for JEE, you cannot do away with Math, for there is Math in Physics and in Chemistry as well. Having taught and mentored thousands of students over multiple years, Sameer Chincholikar, who is one of the Math faculties on the channel, would not only make you fall in love with the subject but also would make your fears go away. He will teach you multiple different approaches to solve a problem and then help you develop the aptitude to choose the best one for that problem. This is quite key, especially in time-bound examinations like JEE. Not only do they cover the entire syllabus and all the important concepts, but also make you practice a significant number of problems. They have these amazing “Sprint” sessions, which are like a one-shot of the entire chapter. If you feel you’re weak in Math, and you want to strengthen your concepts, then you should surely check this channel out!  </p>

                    <h5>2. Mathematically Inclined. </h5>

                    <p>
                        Mathematically Inclined is a YouTube channel run by Neha Agarwal, popularly known as Neha ma’am who wanted to share her love and passion for the subject by providing free and quality content. She has been quite successful in that regard, with her channel crossing over 1 million subscribers. Her charm, her exuberance, and her impressive forbearance make her one of the best teachers of Math on the internet. Her shortcuts and her one-shot videos are great resources if you want to revise the entire syllabus in a short span. She also provides concise handwritten notes, which saves you a lot of time from creating your own. This is a handy channel, especially in the final months of your JEE Mains preparation, where you can hardly afford to put a foot wrong.  
                    </p>

                    <h5>3. Mohit Tyagi. </h5>

                    <p> 

                        A well-known name amongst students across India, Mohit Tyagi is probably the first educator to cover the entire JEE maths syllabus on YouTube, not only for Mains but also for Advanced. Students refer to him as the God of Mathematics, as the quality of content he provides is remarkable. He covers every minute detail of a topic, and his way of teaching is quite interesting and easy to follow. He is one of the most sought-after teachers in Kota, and if you’re getting an opportunity to study from him for free, you must definitely check his channel out.</p>

                        <h3>Subject – Chemistry </h3>
                        <h5>1. IITian Explains  </h5>

                        <p>Most students refer to Inorganic Chemistry as the subject of exceptions. They think of it as a subject where logic doesn’t work and the only way you can secure marks in Inorganic is by mugging up. This is not entirely true. While Inorganic Chemistry is definitely a subject where you would come across a lot of anomalies, and where no “one-size-fits-all” explanation exists, logic does work here. It comes down to a concrete understanding of the subject. And MKA sir is a very good example of a teacher who would help you grasp the concepts and give you a proper understanding of the subject, explaining why a certain element shows a different behavior than the others. What makes MKA sir stand out from the others is his unique teaching style. It is also one of the best channels for learning Organic Chemistry. The in-depth knowledge he possesses regarding each topic is quite impressive. So, if you want to attain confidence in Organic as well as Inorganic Chemistry, and clear your concepts, you must check his channel out.  </p>

                        <h5>2. ATP STAR JEE: </h5>
                        <p>Another great channel for Organic Chemistry, taught by Vineet Khatri sir. He himself is a pass-out from IIT Roorkee. He has a playlist where he covers all the important Organic Chemistry concepts with some relevant illustrations. So, it gives you the ability to search for a particular topic or concept on YouTube in which you’re facing a problem. All his explanations are quite thorough and concise. He also covers concepts from Inorganic Chemistry as well. A great channel for Chemistry, so do check his channel out.  </p>

                        <h5>3. Sachin Rana [IIT-B] </h5>
                        <p>Having recently graduated from IIT-Bombay, his knowledge in the subject of Organic Chemistry is quite profound. And since he’s in his early twenties, you won’t have much problem bonding with him. While his area of expertise lies in Organic Chemistry, his YouTube channel contains tips and tricks for physical and inorganic chemistry too, which he himself used during his JEE days. He currently teaches at Unacademy, and you should check his free classes there. He conducts very important revision sessions before exams which would give you a thorough revision. Last year, a few questions directly came from his lecture notes, not in JEE Mains, but in JEE Advanced. This is proof enough of the depth of knowledge he possesses regarding JEE. After watching his lectures, Organic Chemistry would become a piece of cake for you.  </p>

                        <h5>4. Brijesh Jindal (Unacademy) </h5>
                        <p>For Physical Chemistry, he is one of the best teachers there is. After watching his lectures, Physical Chemistry would become a high-scoring subject for you. He provides a clear and lucid explanation of every single concept and makes students practice a lot of examples, which is quite important in the case of Physical Chemistry. You can access his lectures in the free classes section on Unacademy and strengthen your grip on Physical Chemistry.</p>

                        <p>I hope you found this post helpful. At the end of the day, you’re your own best judge. While all these teachers are quite experienced and possess enormous knowledge regarding their subject, what’s also important is that you can follow along and connect with that teacher. So, if you feel some of the channels/teachers are not meant for you, please feel free to explore other options.  
                        </p>

                        <p>All the best for your preparation! I hope you do well in your exam! </p>
