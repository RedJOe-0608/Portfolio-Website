            <h1>The World Around Books, and their Importance. </h1>
            <div class="article-content">
              <p>The universe has been graced by tales and stories since times immemorial. It was once a tiny, dense fireball that exploded into life approximately 13.8 billion years ago and continues to expand at an ever-accelerating pace. This is known as “The Big-Bang Theory,” which virtually all cosmologists and theoretical physicists endorse. The Big Bang Theory also marks the origin of tales and stories, and somewhere in this majestic tale of the universe, in a particular sub-plot of a sub-plot, came to life the existence of a planet known as the Earth. And somewhere, in the majestic tale of our planet Earth, in a particular sub-plot of a sub-plot, came to life the existence of the most supreme species of all time – homo sapiens. And somewhere, in the majestic tale of the rise of homo sapiens, in a particular sub-plot, came to life the existence of books. </p>
                <img src="./img/Books Article Image.jpg" class="img article-image" alt="">
                
                <p>So, at a quite larger scale, the tale of the origin of books has a profound history attached to it.  And around 130 million books have been published so far in the history of humanity. Books are the articulation of thoughts and feelings; the distillation of years of experience of the sharpest minds to have ever graced this planet. Books are proof of the dextrous craftsmanship of the author. They serve as an excellent beacon of knowledge and help us in understanding the nuances and intricacies of life. Perhaps that's why so many successful people advise us to inculcate the habit of reading.  </p>

                <p>Reading books has many benefits. They give us a window into other people’s thoughts and feelings. Not only do they inculcate a sense of perception within us, but they also help in viewing the world around us in a different light. The ability to read and understand what the author is saying and then being able to quickly paint that scenario in your head sharpens your imaginative skills. When faced with any kind of predicament in your life, this quality would enable you to better understand and analyze that situation, and consequently, take better action. </p>

                <p>Reading would enhance your arsenal of words. The more you read, the more prominent your vocabulary would get, and the firmer your grip would be, on that particular language. Your reading speed would also undergo a massive improvement. </p>

                <p>We human beings are social animals, and emotions are at the core of our very being. Reading books from multiple genres exposes you to various kinds of emotions. On certain occasions, the journey of reading a book is as plain and humdrum as it gets. Whilst on others, it’s like going on a roller-coaster journey of emotions; A character dying in the book might feel like someone close to you passing away. A dramatic plot in the book might make you oblivious to your surroundings, as you persevere through it with bated breath with your gaze riveted to the pages. This is exactly what an author wants his book to do – to help the readers feel these distinctive feelings. To make them feel more human. And herein lies the real magic. </p>

                <p>There is this invisible world of imagination woven around books; and the beautiful part about it is that you can dive as deep as you like but you can never reach the bottom; it's because the world of imagination is infinite. This is the primary objective of every author, to draw their readers away from this harsh reality and transport them into an imaginative world, a world painted solely by the author. And sometimes the native residents of this world, the fictional characters, tend to have a much bigger impact than the many non-fictional characters of our lives; that's how dextrously sketched they are by the authors. And oftentimes these characters become the best of our companions in the worst of our times, and we develop such a strong connection that we start to empathize with them. And as we reach the end of the story, some of these characters become so embedded into us that we extract lessons from their experiences and start implementing them in our lives. And so, the souls of these characters do not fade away the moment we finish the book. They descend into our mortal realm from the imaginative world and become a part of us.  </p>

                <p>The more journeys we make to these captivating worlds, the better our understanding becomes of our real world. The more we carefully observe and learn about the residents of these captivating worlds, the better equipped we would be to empathize with and understand the residents of our real world. And thus, the more captivating our reality would become. </p>

                <p>Obviously, books don’t write themselves. They are a medium through which people help other people. Be it a beautiful rendition of a morning sunrise, or of a crowded metro train during the rush hour, or be it just the sound of the carefree laughter of children playing on the streets, authors through books can help us observe and appreciate the beauty in the everyday things around us. They eloquently elucidate centuries of happenings in a few hundreds of pages, thereby ensuring that the present and future generations are fully resourced about the happenings of the past. Books can teach you about dynasties and emperors who ruled thousands of years ago. They can take you to the battlefront and make you witness the horrors of merciless killing and bloodshed first-hand. They can take you on a journey to the most exotic places on the globe, without you having to leave your room. They can teach you French, Spanish, Hindi, how to cook, how to do farming, how to start a business, how to be a leader, basically, how to -everything. They can be your best of friends in your worst of times. They can shatter barriers and unite people. They can inspire and motivate them. They can spread awareness and potentially solve global issues like climate change. They can stop wars. They possess the power to make us slightly better human beings, which, in turn, would make this world a slightly better place.
