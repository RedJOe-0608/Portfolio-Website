                    Perhaps, the biggest leap of faith of them all – is to give your heart to a person who lives thousands of miles away from you. Long-Distance-Relationships (or LDRs, as they’re popularly known) come with no guarantees but with infinite possibilities. With the advancement of technology, we can virtually see the other person in real-time via video calls, irrespective of their distance. We enjoy the luxury of getting instant replies to our messages, compared to medieval times when couples had to hang fire for weeks and months to get a reply from their loved ones. Without a doubt, LDRs are gruesome; being so far away from your partner might feel quite intimidating and lonely. But in today’s world, LDRs can be pulled off. As long as the foundation is solid, the thousands of miles of distance and the varying time zones between you cannot uproot the tree of love which you both planted. 
                </p>

                <p>
                And this is true in the case of regular relationships as well. If your foundation turns out to be giddy, then chances are your relationship would not survive the various shenanigans of life. So, what exactly is the foundation of any relationship built on? It is built on trust. How do you build trust? Well, I suppose that’s the billion-dollar question, correct? People who have been betrayed and hurt by others in the past do not allow themselves to trust people easily. Whereas some trust people way too easily and blindly. For the sake of your mental sanity, you need to find the right sort of balance. If you both are genuinely interested in each other, then you have to be willing to go the extra mile to win each other’s trust. It might take you months, maybe even years. But you both need to develop a forbearing attitude, for the process of building trust cannot be rushed. You have to make each other feel safe so that you both feel secure enough to let your guard down. And once you let your guards down, you start being vulnerable with each other. You start sharing your likes, dislikes, thoughts, and feelings. You trust in each other by sharing your secrets, your political views, and opinions on various things, and over time, possibly your heart, and eventually, your life. And this is how you “bond” with people.  
            </p>
  
                   <p>A long-distance relationship bifurcates from the path of a normal one after the “bonding” stage when you want to take your relationship to the “next level.” In the case of regular relationships, the next level could mean going out for lunch, dinner, sleeping together, meeting each other’s parents, getting engaged, and so on and so forth. Obviously, the transition of your relationship from the first time you met to your engagement isn’t a piece of cake. But it's easier to have a long-term vision in the case of regular relationships. In the case of LDRs, it is quite different. The next level could mean seeing your partner for the very first time, feeling their touch, and holding them, making gradual efforts to try and reduce the distance between you both, trying to move into the same city as your partner, and so on. It demands significantly greater commitment and methodical planning.</p>

                   <p>Yes, to not have their warming presence around your body, or to not be able to breathe the same air as they do, in all honesty – can seem daunting. While we all crave those affectionate human touches, especially from the one we love, we also crave to be understood; And Long-Distance Relationships are entirely about the latter. Although the fundamental truth is that you both are not next to each other, you can still further understand and expand your knowledge about each other by maintaining complete transparency. Discussing your day, sharing the little magical things that have managed to catch your attention, talking about those intricate thoughts that have been bothering you, those feelings which you’ve been bottling up for a while; all this, while being completely honest about your situation, about the distance which separates you, can help you both explore new dimensions about your relationship. It solely relies on communication and perpetuates on the basis of how effectively you communicate your ambitions, desires, and feelings.  </p>

                   <p>They also help you appreciate the importance of little things. They help you acknowledge the existence of an inner world inside every person. Falling in love with someone so far away from you is basically taking a deep dive into this world. The inner world isn’t made of bricks and cement; it is made up of thoughts and feelings. And so, the farther you venture, the more you realize how the person is at their core. To be able to witness and make sense of some of their deepest thoughts and desires is indeed like viewing a person naked in the metaphorical sense. </p>

                   <p>You do not have to browse through the statistics and success rates of long-distance relationships before getting into one. Everyone’s story is different, and if you feel a connection with that person all those miles away, you should definitely give it a try. You might end up getting heartbroken, but yet again, isn’t that the beauty of any relationship in general, the gigantic leap of faith?   </p>
