            <div class="article-content">
               <p>To this day, the phrase “mental health” lies on the receiving end of awkward glances and uncomfortable silences. Sparking a conversation about it is like venturing into unknown territory, but the main question that remains unanswered even to this day, is why is the territory still anonymous to most of us? Why is it still considered taboo to be talked about? Even though it’s an epidemic that has assailed all humanity for centuries, there exists a lack of awareness and proper education about it. Humans are social animals, and emotions are at the core of our very being. We learn about the way our heart pumps blood; we learn about how our brain relays information to the rest of our body via neurons; We learn about our reproductive organs; we learn about our digestive system and other parts of our body. While knowing our body functions is absolutely essential, and one hundred percent they should be a part of every teaching curriculum, we simply can’t do away without learning about the most fundamental trait which makes us human, i.e., emotions.  </p>
                <img src="./img/mental health article.jpg" class="img article-image" alt="">
                
                <p>Imagine a scenario, where a “certain something” happens in your physical environment, which brings about a thought inside your mind. Now this thought, in turn, makes you feel something. And then, based on how you feel, you respond in a particular manner. So, the happening of that “certain something” planted a seed of thought inside your head, which ultimately grew into a feeling, watered by your meticulous thinking. It’s all merry as long as the seed of thought is fresh and pleasant. A gleeful sapling grows out of the seed, and you project it out into the world with a joyous response. But what happens if the seed turns out to be sour? Or anxious? Or pessimistic? What if, not one, but multiple such seeds get planted?  All these seeds and the resulting saplings which grow out of them ultimately result in a garden, epitomizing your thoughts and feelings, thereby forming the very basis of your behaviour. You’ll start observing that some of the seeds that have been planted are not a direct consequence of the happenings in your physical environment, but a ramification of the already present seeds and saplings in your garden. What this means is that a single thought could give rise to multiple different thoughts, which in turn could do the same, thereby leaving us with a situation where our garden needs desperate attending to.   </p>

                <p>If you do not remove the troubling seeds before they mature into a sapling, or at least take care of these unwanted saplings after they’ve grown, or continue to properly water the healthy ones, and treat your soil regularly from time to time, your garden would soon start deteriorating. Every negative seed that gets planted drains the soil of its fertility, which means every positive seed which gets planted henceforth would lose a bit of its ability to create that positive impact on you. A mind in chaos and a heart with unattended feelings would take a massive toll on you, thereby affecting various aspects of your life.</p>

                <p>This is what I’d like to call the “Theory of Behavioral Gardening.” (The garden here is a metaphor for our behavioral patterns, based on the type of seeds and saplings growing in our garden.) And the fact is, it has so much resemblance with normal gardening. If you wake up tomorrow and start gardening without having any prior knowledge about it, chances are, your plants are going to die. People are not going to be overly critical about it, for they understand the fact that you do not know anything about gardening, and that gardening is a skill that you acquire by educating yourself about it. So, you go and do your homework. You learn about the different types of seeds; You learn about the importance of soil and how you can keep it healthy. You learn about how to properly water your plants and identify which ones are decaying so that you can properly attend to them. And unsurprisingly, your garden looks beautiful and healthy. So, similarly to normal gardening, behavioral gardening is a skill that you “acquire”; it’s not something that should be expected of you to be known naturally. You can learn about the various thoughts traversing your mind. You can learn about the various feelings which mature out of them and understand which ones are unnecessary and need uprooting, and which ones need to thrive so that you can properly water them by reminding yourself of the seed of thought which gave rise to it. You can learn how to handle yourself in the midst of all these thoughts and feelings. You can learn how to acknowledge the presence of a negative thought, and then attend to it as soon as possible. The longer it stays, the more numbing the effect of the other good/positive thoughts present.</p>

                <p>So, the “Theory of Behavioural Gardening”, which clearly holds such paramount importance, should be deemed an essential skill to learn. It is overwhelming, and you’re not expected to figure it out all by yourself. Some do, whilst others find themselves stuck in a labyrinth. But every feeling was once a thought, and if only “asking for help” would have been normalized, and talking openly about things that concern you wouldn’t be on the receiving end of shrewd judgment and perplexing gazes, then maybe, you never would have found yourself stuck in the first place. Yes, the issues run much deep than this, but the first step towards promoting mental health is encouraging people to talk about it. The reason why few people conjure up the courage to talk about their mental health is that they believe there is no cure to the problem they are facing. Sometimes, all you need is another soul to help you navigate to the core of the problem you’re facing. It can be a friend, a relative, your partner, a professional, whoever. You can also try therapy; and no, you shouldn’t be feeling ashamed about it. Going for therapy doesn’t mean you are crazy; It just demonstrates your desire to better understand yourself and the situation you’re in by seeking help from a professional. Whether you’re an individual who likes to deep-dive into the intricacies and nuances of life, or you’re somebody who just likes to scratch the surface of it, having the ability to deal with the negative thoughts and understand why you feel what you feel would not only massively help you, but would also allow you to help others. It will give you the ability to empathize with others, and understand them. Who knows, in some extreme cases, you might even end up saving a life. That is how you can create harmony. Hence, bursting the myths around mental health and actively spreading awareness about socio-emotional learning, and ensuring access to proper mental health care can help build a world where people are more aware of their thoughts and feelings and are leading more prosperous and fulfilled lives.   </p>
